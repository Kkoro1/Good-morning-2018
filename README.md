# Good-morning-2018

Hello...humans of earth

I'm definitely not a robot but I sure seem to act like one,
I would * love * to control the world through tech ;)

Jk, I'm human and an artist, with an interest in law and computer science
I'm only here to figure many things out, also wouldn't it be cool to have a program that lets you do whatever you want?

Who knows, maybe in 20 years robots and code will control the world * Mwahahahaha *
Maybe they'll be friendly and not destroy humanity, maybe they'll enslave us.

Ya, I'm a cynic and a pessimist, who cares? no one... well I don't know that my brain doesn't let me understand that

Maybe we're all being controlled by robots, maybe we go through our days mechanically.
What if we're actually robots and the enslavement of humanity has already happened

Sincerly,
Robot
